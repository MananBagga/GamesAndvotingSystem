# GamesAndvotingSystem
This project contains 2 Games - Tic Tac Toe and Sudoku Solver and A voting system using Linked List data Structure. Uses algorithms like linked list traversal, deleting nodes, backtracking, etc.

Voting System and Games

This project combines a Voting System with two classic games, Tic Tac Toe and Sudoku, offering a comprehensive demonstration of C++ programming skills, file handling, data structures, and algorithms.

Features:

Voting System:

Allows users to cast votes for political parties.
Supports functionalities like registering voters, checking voter eligibility based on age, viewing total votes casted, deleting voters by ID, and displaying the winning party.
Data for voters is stored and retrieved using linked list data structure.
Utilizes file handling to store and retrieve voter data, ensuring data persistence between sessions.
Tic Tac Toe Game:

Classic two-player Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++.
Supports player authentication to ensure secure gameplay.
Players can enter their moves using numeric keypad positions.
Displays the board and announces the winner or a tie.
Enhances user experience with colorful output using ANSI escape codes.
Sudoku Solver:

Solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithm.
Provides users with the solved Sudoku grids for two test cases.
Utilizes a recursive approach to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently.
Validates the solved grids using a function to ensure correctness.
Data Structures and Algorithms:

Voting System:

Utilizes a linked list to manage voter records efficiently.
Implements algorithms for basic linked list operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Validates voter IDs to ensure uniqueness using linear search algorithm.
Tic Tac Toe Game:

Represents the game board using a 2D array of characters.
Employs conditional statements to check for winning conditions.
Implements player input validation to ensure valid moves.
Sudoku Solver:

Uses a 2D vector to represent Sudoku grids.
Implements backtracking algorithm recursively to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently.
Validates solved grids using a function to ensure adherence to Sudoku rules.
Other Key Points:

Provides a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and colorful output.
Implements secure user authentication for accessing game functionalities.
Ensures robust error handling and validation mechanisms for user inputs.
Demonstrates proficiency in C++ programming concepts, including file handling, input/output operations, conditional statements, loops, and functions.
